# Frontend Mentor - Product list with cart

![Design preview for the Product list with cart coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 32nd Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.


This project features an interactive product list that allows users to browse, add items to a cart, and manage quantities.

1. **Product Display:**
   - Products are shown with details like name, image, price, and category.
   - Each product has an "Add to Cart" button.

2. **Quantity Management:**
   - Users can adjust quantities using increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons.
   - Quantities are displayed next to these buttons.

3. **Cart Functionality:**
   - The cart displays added products with their name, quantity, per unit price, and total price.
   - A cross button allows for removing items.
   - Total quantity and total price of the cart are shown.

4. **Order Confirmation:**
   - Clicking "Confirm Order" opens a dialog showing:
     - Each item's image, name, quantity, per unit price, and total price.
     - The overall total price of the order.

This project provides a complete shopping cart experience, from browsing products to confirming an order. This challenge was a good practice to display data dynamically using JS DOM.


**Had fun building this!** ðŸš€
